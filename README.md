# Goals-Fullstack-MERN-App
This was project where I learned Fullstack MERN skills ( node,express,postman,mongoose,redux, react...)
The app consists of this features:
  - Login (if user is already registered, and in database - moongodb)
  - Register (if new user)
  - Adding goals, editing goals, deleting goals
